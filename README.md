# Image Recognition Project
This project uses TensorFlow machine learning library to create an image recognition project capable of recognizing cats from dogs. The project uses the following libraries:

tensorflow
tensorflow.keras
tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image
tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential
tensorflow.keras.layers.Conv2D
tensorflow.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D
tensorflow.keras.layers.Flatten
tensorflow.keras.layers.Dense
Project Overview
The project consists of the following steps:

Define the directories for the training and validation data
Define the image size and batch size
Define the data generators for the training and validation data
Define the model architecture
Compile the model
Train the model
Save the model
